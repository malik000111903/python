# Define the tuple
myfamily = ("mother", "father", "sister", "brother", "sister")

# Print the tuple
print(myfamily)

# 1. Use type() to check the type of the object myfamily
print("Type of myfamily:", type(myfamily))

# 2. Access tuple items 'sister' using index numbers
print("First 'sister':", myfamily[2])  # The first 'sister' is at index 2
print("Second 'sister':", myfamily[4]) # The second 'sister' is at index 4
